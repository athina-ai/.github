## Open-Source SDK for Evals
[athina-ai/athina-evals](https://github.com/athina-ai/athina-evals)

[Documentation](https://docs.athina.ai/evals) | [Quick Start](https://docs.athina.ai/evals/quick_start) | [Running Evals](https://docs.athina.ai/evals/running_evals) 

We have a library of preset evaluators, but you can also write custom evaluators within the Athina framework. 

#### Example Preset Evals:

- **Context Contains Enough Information**: Detect bad or insufficient retrievals.
- **Does Response Answer Query**: Detect incomplete or irrelevant responses.
- **Response Faithfulness**: Detect when responses are deviating from the provided context.
- **Summarization Accuracy**: Detect hallucinations and mistakes in summaries
- **Grading Criteria**: If X, then fail. Otherwise pass.
- **Custom Evals**: Custom prompt for LLM-powered evaluation.
- **RAGAS**: A set of evaluators that return [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) metrics.

Results can also be viewed and tracked on our platform.
